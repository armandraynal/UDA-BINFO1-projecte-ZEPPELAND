ZEPPELAND is a student project for Arduino at the University of Andorra. Its purpose is to make a zeppelin with a main electrical engine and 
maybe make it energetically autonomous with solar panels. The objective is to at least make it flying with a remote controler linked by 
blutooth and then inplement some static skills as, for exemple, reduce acceleration caused by wind in static flight to keep it stable.
All help and colaborations are welcomed.
